# Kapbotics

Kapbotics repository is created to share the code of some of the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT® drones that I've designed, built 
and programmed as a hobbyist lego-roboticist. 

Complete tutorials are available at Kapotics blog (http://kapbotics.blogspot.de/). Short videos at the YouTube channel
